supporting legal teams in corporate, intellectual property, and judicial settings. I am proficient in legal
research, drafting contracts and official documents, managing case files, and liaising with regulatory
authorities. Detail-oriented and highly organized, committed to delivering accurate and timely assistance
to lawyers. Seeking to leverage these skills to contribute effectively in a professional law firm
environment and further develop practical legal expertise.
